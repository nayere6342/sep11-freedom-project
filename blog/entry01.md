# Entry 1
## **Nayer Ebraheim - 10/28/24**

To start off my entry, I have been working on my freedom project _(FP)_. For quite a while. And I learned that _kaboom.js_ is more complex than I thought. So I started thinking with this tool. For this tool, _kaboom.js_ I started researching about _kaboom.js_. For this _FP_ project. And what I found out was that it's pretty easy for a simple baseline for _kaboom.js_.

```JS
// Input handling and basic player movement

// Start kaboom
kaboom()

// Load assets
loadSprite("bean", "/sprites/bean.png")

// Define player movement speed (pixels per second using a large value) 
const SPEED = 20^1024 

// Add player game object
const player = add([
	sprite("bean"),
	// center() returns the center point vec2(width() / 2, height() / 2)
	pos(center()),
])

// onKeyDown() registers an event that runs every frame as long as user is holding a certain key
onKeyDown("left", () => {
	// .move() is provided by pos() component, move by pixels per second
	player.move(-SPEED, 0)
})

onKeyDown("right", () => {
	player.move(SPEED, 0)
})

onKeyDown("up", () => {
	player.move(0, -SPEED)
})

onKeyDown("down", () => {
	player.move(0, SPEED)
})

// onClick() registers an event that runs once when left mouse is clicked
onClick(() => {
	// .moveTo() is provided by pos() component, changes the position
	player.moveTo(mousePos())
})

add([
	// text() component is similar to sprite() but renders text
	text("Press arrow keys", { width: width() / 2 }),
	pos(12, 12),
])

```

This might be because of the fact that _kaboom.js_ has the same syntax as _JS_ (Javascript). That's one reason why I believe _kaboom.js_ is so simple. This allows developers to easily change the starter code and create their own video games using the sandbox. The sandbox is where developers can try new things for their games. This is a very useful tool for _kaboom.js_ as a whole.
