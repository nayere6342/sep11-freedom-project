## **Intro:**

In this entry, I will go over the presention from my freedom project which I showed in class. By this fact I'm sure that there is a ton of things I talk about. But I'll just talk about this presention and the expo. The presention was great I hit all the points I needed to do while presenting. The presention it self was real simple I got the code out and I explained how the code itself worked. I basiclly nerded out over the whole thing. Like I always do when it comes to those project you kind-of have to do so.
